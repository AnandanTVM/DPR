        TRAVEL DEMAND FORECAST As part of the DPR Study of Semi High Speed Rail 
        (SilverLine), connecting Thiruvananthapuram and Kasaragod, detailed study of 
        existing transportation system and travel characteristics of Kerala State has 
        been undertaken. Information on the demographic and Socio-Economic factors, 
        influencing the travel pattern have also been compiled. Review of earlier 
        traffic studies have been carried out, along with the methodology adopted and 
        salient findings. The same is summarised in this section. This section of the 
        DPR provides the details of primary and secondary traffic surveys and ridership 
        forecast of SilverLine for different horizon years. 4.1 STUDY AREA PROFILE 4.1.1 
        Introduction – The Study Area Kerala, the greenest State, located on the 
        Southernmost tip of India, blessed with excellent tropical weather and networked 
        by 44 rivers, 34 lakes, canals, ponds, and paddy fields, is popularly known as 
        God’s Own Country. This lush green strip of land lying between the Arabian sea 
        and the steep Western Ghats has an area of about 38,863 Sq.Km and is inhabited 
        by about 33.41 million people as per 2011 Census. Kerala stretches for about 580 
        km along the Arabian Coast, varying in width from roughly 30 km to 120 km. It is 
        bordered by the States of Karnataka in the north, Tamil Nadu in the east and 
        Arabian Sea in the west and south. The administrative capital of Kerala is 
        Thiruvananthapuram, which is a major destination for tourists. Kochi and 
        Kozhikode are the other two major cities with lot of industrial developments. 
        The proposed SilverLine project envisage Semi High Speed Rail connectivity 
        between Thiruvananthapuram and Kasaragod, with intermediate stops at key 
        economic centres of the districts, such as Kollam, Kottayam, Ernakulam, 
        Thrissur, Calicut, Kannur etc. Figure 4-1 given below presents the study area 
        map of the proposed SilverLine project and its indicative alignment.</p>

        The major competing highway running almost parallel to proposed alignment is 
        NH66. Another competing highway is Main Central Road (MC Road) which starts at 
        Kesavadasapuram in Thiruvananthapuram district and ends at Angamaly in Ernakulam 
        district. M C Road is parallel to proposed SilverLine alignment up to Ernakulam. 
        4.1.1.1 Rationale for SilverLine Station Locations Public transport terminals 
        such as Railway station or inter-state bus terminals have always been places of 
        central importance in the structure of a city through which people orient and 
        identify themselves. Key in this role, is the location of the transit nodes. As 
        evidenced by the locations of railway stations in Kerala, these have generally 
        been in the centre of the city that allows it to not only serve its role in 
        terms of place making but also satisfying ideal transit requirements of even 
        dispersal to the city while doubling as an interchange point. However, as cities 
        have developed in size and population, practical issues of land availability and 
        congestion adversely affecting accessibility has made newer transit nodes to be 
        shifted to the suburbs of the city. While this has served the transportation 
        purposes of railway stations &amp; bus terminals in terms of easier accessibility 
        for rail and buses, it has almost reduced the role of terminal as a node.</p>
    <p class="text-center">
        Considerations: There are a number of considerations in deciding the best 
        location. The location should be where routes should logically connect or 
        terminate, as determined by passenger demand patterns. If the station is used as 
        an intermediate stopping point on routes passing through, it should be 
        conveniently located for passengers joining or leaving vehicles. New transport 
        terminals are also located outside central areas to avoid high land costs and 
        congestion. But this shall be conflicting with increasing dispersal trip length 
        within the city which causes inconvenience to users. So, the parameters for 
        selection of station location can have different dimensions with regards to 
        perspective of SilverLine commuter and SilverLine operator. To determine the 
        location for a new bus terminal, the following indicative criteria are 
        considered. Depending on the project objectives and complexity the criteria can 
        be adopted. They are:- a) Distance from Catchments (Average Trip Length of Pax 
        within City) – mainly user perspective b) Scope of Multimodal Integration (Other 
        Modes within walking distances) – user perspective c) Proximity of the Land with 
        the other rail, bus, air and water modes – user perspective d) Land Price / Real 
        Estate Value – operator perspective e) Commercial Development Potential / TOD 
        Potential – Operator perspective f) Environmental / R&amp;R Consideration – Operator 
        perspective From the above parameters, there must be a balance between both the 
        perspectives in finalisation of the ideal locations. For the SilverLine station 
        location, the following parameters have been considered based on the priority: - 
        1) Alignment: the route was decided based on the existing railway line, 
        practicality to build new line and the topography of Kerala. The cities and 
        towns for stations were selected based on the proximity to the macro-level 
        tentative alignment fixed during pre-feasibility stage. 2) Catchments in terms 
        of population: if a tier 1 city is along the alignment, then priority was given 
        to that particular city, followed by towns under tier II and tier III. 3) 
        Administrative headquarter – if the city or town is district headquarter, 
        priority was given to district HQ for location of Silverline station. 4) One 
        district one station principle – in a district, if one location has been 
        identified as SilverLine station, no other city may be considered. But, station 
        for airport connectivity may be considered. 5) Station-wise passenger handled 
        and earnings – the performance of the existing railway stations along the 
        tentative alignment based on number originating passengers and passenger 
        earnings is also considered. The best performing stations and respective cities 
        or towns will be giver higher priority. 6) Secondary Data: Consideration from 
        previous studies as follows:- a. Kerala High Speed Rail Corridor between 
        Thiruvananthapuram and Kannur Detailed Project Report - June 2016 prepared by 
        DMRC suggested ten stations proposed in the first phase which includes 
        Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Chengannur, Kottayam, Kochi, Thrissur, Valanchery, 
        Kozhikode, Kannur, and Kasaragod. One more station is planned in the next phase 
        at Nedumbassery. b. Traffic &amp; Transportation Study for preparation of DPR for 
        Kerala High Speed Rail – 2017; updated traffic report prepared by iMacS 
        suggested Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Chengannur, Kottayam, Kochi, Thrissur, 
        Valanchery, Kozhikode, Kannur, Kasargod and Mangalore as Station locations. 
        Based on the above, for each major sections along the alignment, following major 
        urban agglomerations and towns were considered.</p>

    <p class="text-center">
        From the above table, from Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Kottayam, Ernakulam, 
        Trissur, Kozhikode and Kannur, the urban agglomerations are selected for station 
        locations. It is also observed that, they also serve as district HQs. As the 
        alignment do not pass through Alapuzha UA, it cannot be selected. The towns from 
        Alapuzha, Pathanamthitta, Malapuram and Kasaragod as station locations will have 
        to finalised based on the performance of existing railway stations as there are 
        multiple towns other than district HQs along the alignment which are probable 
        for having stations.</p>
    <p class="style4">
        <strong><em>Performance of Existing Railway Stations </em></strong>
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
        The performance of existing railway stations in terms of passenger handled and

    <p class="text-center">
        From the above table, Tirur between Malapuram and Kozhikode and Kasaragod 
        between Kannur and Kasaragod can be finalised for station location. Kanhangad is 
        also a major UA within the region and also performing similar to Kasaragod in 
        terms of passenger and earnings but being the District HQ, Kasaragod can be 
        finalised. Regarding connectivity to airports, Kochi may be considered for 
        connectivity as it is along the alignment and is also major international 
        airport. Other airport connectivity may be decided based on the daily ridership.</p>

        Kerala has been ahead of other Indian States in achieving demographic and human 
        development indicators. In achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 
        2018) by the States in India as computed by the NITI Aayog, Kerala ranks first 
        along with Himachal Pradesh, with a score of 69 against national average of 57. 
        Kerala ranks first in SDGs relating to health, education, and gender equality. 
        Public investment in educational infrastructure and quality is a priority and as 
        a consequence the enrolment of students in Government and Government aided 
        schools has increased.</p>

        <strong><em>Employment in the Organized &amp; Unorganised Sector</em></strong></p>
    <p class="style5">
        Employment in organized sector: As per the Economic Review 2018, ‘In Kerala, 
        employment in the organized sector has remained more or less stagnant, showing 
        only a marginal increase from 10.89 lakh in 2012 to 12.14 lakh in 2018. The 
        reason behind this trend is due to the movement of the labor force to the public 
        sector which provides more employment in the State. The organized sector 
        comprises private and public sectors and it is noteworthy that private sector 
        employment is steadily increasing since 2011 onwards. In 2018, out of 12.14 lakh 
        persons employed in the organized sector, 5.54 lakh (46%) are in the public 
        sector and 6.60 lakh (54%) are in the private sector. Within the public sector 
        employment 46% are employed in State Government, 11% in Central Government, 24% 
        are in State quasi-institutions, 4% in LSGIs and 15% are in Central 
        quasi-institutions. In private sector, the employment is distributed between 21 
        sectors and citizens are mostly employed in manufacturing sector which 26.6%, 
        followed by education (22.5%), administrative and support (9.8%), 
        agriculture/forestry/fishing (8.3%), Information and communication (7.9%) etc.</p>
    <p class="style5">
        Data on District-wise employment as on March 2018 reveals that Ernakulam and 
        Wayanad are the two Districts which respectively accounted for the highest and 
        lowest employment. Total organized sector employment in Ernakulum District is 
        2.47 lakh persons, which accounted for 20% of the total employment of the State. 
        Whereas in Wayanad, the employment under the organized sector is 0.35 lakh 
        persons, which accounted for 3% of the total employment. In Kerala, men 
        outnumbered women in public sector employment and women outnumbered men in 
        private sector employment. The share of men is 66% of public sector employment 
        while that of women is 51% of total private sector employment. 
        Thiruvananthapuram and Idukki are the two Districts which respectively accounted 
        for the highest and lowest women participation in public sector employment. In 
        Thiruvananthapuram, 31,037 women are employed in the public sector followed by 
        Ernakulam (22,849), Thrissur (21,891) and Kollam (18,783). Whereas in Idukki, 
        3,387 women are employed in the public sector followed by Kasaragod (6,502), 
        Wayanad (6,814), and Pathanamthitta (8,266)’. Employment in unorganized Sector: 
        As per economic review 2019, ‘More than 90 per cent of workforce and nearly 50 
        per cent of the Gross Domestic Product is attributable to this sector. A high 
        proportion of socially and economically weaker sections of society are engaged 
        in the unorganised economic activities in India and Kerala. As per the PLFS 
        2017-18 report published by GoI, based on usual status (ps+ss) approach, it is 
        estimated that self-employed workers in Kerala constituted 40.7 per cent of the 
        total workers, while the share of regular wage/ salaried employee was 24.7 per 
        cent’. As per census 2011, the main worker population in Kerala constitute to 
        93,29,747 workers.</p>

        <strong><em>Remittances - Contribution to Kerala Economy</em></strong></p>
    <p class="style6">
        As per the world bank, the top remittance recipients were India with $79 
        billion, followed by China ($67 billion), Mexico ($36 billion), the Philippines 
        ($34 billion), and Egypt ($29 billion). In 2019, remittance flows to low- and 
        middle-income countries were predicted to reach $550 billion, to become their 
        largest source of external financing. In India, Kerala State accounts for the 
        highest remittance with 19%. The Centre for development studies (CDS), Kerala; 
        conducted Kerala Migration Survey and the results were published through the 
        working paper – 483, Emigration and Remittances: New Evidences from the Kerala 
        Migration Survey (KMS), 2018. The working paper was published in 2019 and the 
        major outcomes of the survey are as follows:-</p>
    <p class="style6">
&nbsp;a) There are 2.1 million emigrants from Kerala across the world, and among the 14 
        districts, four (Malappuram, Kannur, Thrissur, and Kollam) account for 50% of 
        the emigrants.</p>
    <p class="style6">
        b) The estimated total remittances to Kerala are Rs 85,000 crore as per KMS 
        2018. Within Kerala, one-fifth of the total remittance is to Malappuram (21%), 
        followed by Kollam (15%) and Thrissur (11%).</p>
    <p class="style6">
&nbsp;c) Remittances as percent of NSDP was 25.5% in 1998, 30.7% in 2008 and increased 
        to 36.3 in 2014 and suddenly declined to 19.3% in 2018. d) Emigration figures 
        showed a constant increase during the period 1998-2013 (34.9%) but declined 
        thereafter till 2018 and indicated negative growth of 11.6% compared to 2013. 
        The main reasons for the decline are as follows:-
    </p>
    <p class="style6">
        (1) Demographic advances have decreased the population in the migrationprone age 
        group (15-29 years) since Kerala attained replacement-level fertility as early 
        as 1987.</p>
    <p class="style6">
&nbsp;(2) Wage levels in the Gulf economies have not improved after the global financial 
        crisis.</p>
    <p class="style6">
&nbsp;(3) Wages in the domestic economy have increased compared to other states; Kerala 
        has the highest wage rate in the informal sector in India.</p>
    <p class="style6">
&nbsp;(4) Prices of oil have been declining since 2010 and construction and other 
        services are not as vibrant as it used to be.</p>
    <p class="style6">
        (5) Due to Nationalisation policies such as Nitaqat and recently introduced 
        family taxes in Saudi Arabia, the Gulf economies are not conducive for current 
        and prospective migrants.
    </p>
    <p class="style6">
        (6) Decades of investment in education have made Keralites skilled. Highskilled 
        labour migrates to other parts of the world, mainly to the developed economies 
        in the West.
    </p>
    <p class="style6">
        e) The emigrants are now concentrating more on investing in buying a car, 
        starting an enterprise, and for education purposes, which increased by a 
        percentage growth rate of 283.9% from 2013 to 2018. There was also increase in 
        usage of remittance for household consumption (increased by 29%). A reduction in 
        real estate in 2018 by 49.9% was also observed. This may be due to decline in 
        real estate prices. 4.1.4.5 Proposed Projects and Investments in Kerala The 
        development in manufacturing sector and IT sector which will generate employment 
        and is expected that a percentage of regional trips to shift to SilverLine. As 
        per the Ascend 2020 conducted by the Government of Kerala, the investment in

        <strong><em>Transport Sector Projects and Initiatives</em></strong></p>
    <p class="style6">
&nbsp;The Govt. of Kerala has been a front runner in promoting public transport. 
        However, in the recent past, a trend towards the personalised transport has been 
        observed and therefore the Govt. has decided to revitalise public transport, and 
        improve the road &amp; rail infrastructure with focus on modern transportation 
        systems and globally recognised best practices. The projects and initiatives can 
        be divided into categories such as initiatives at Policy level, Urban transport, 
        road infrastructure, rail infrastructure etc. The projects and initiatives are 
        the following:- At Policy Level:- • Approval of Kerala Metropolitan Transport 
        Authority (KMTA) Bill: As per the KMTA Act, Metropolitan Transport Authorities 
        will be formed in three major cities - Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode - 
        and they will be declared urban mobility areas. The authority will be the 
        umbrella body which is responsible for the development, operation, maintenance, 
        monitoring and supervision of urban transport in urban mobility areas. As per 
        the union government’s Metro Rail policy, the formation of a Unified 
        Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) is a prerequisite for Metro Rail 
        projects. Integration of different modes of transport, seamless ticketing, fare 
        revision, renovation of the bus transport system and other activities come under 
        KMTA. Parking policy, intelligent transport facility and other amenities also 
        come under the purview of authority. The main responsibility of KMTA are:- o 
        Bring an integration of various departments related to the urban transport 
        sector o Better, effective solutions to issues in urban transport sector o KMTA 
        to prioritise actions based on future transport requirements o Overseeing urban 
        transport policy for urban mobility areas o Managing network of integrated 
        transport, including rail, boats, buses, cabs, rickshaws • Draft Electric 
        Vehicle (EV) Policy for Kerala is prepared • Public Transport Policy for Kerala 
        is under preparation • Road Safety Action Plan is under preparation • Private 
        Participation in Passenger Trains: Ministry of Railways and National Institution 
        for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog, Government of India are spearheading 
        participation of private entities in operation of passenger trains on 100 
        routes. It is presently under tendering stage. • Faster Adoption and 
        Manufacturing of (Hybrid &amp;) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme: The 
        National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 is a National Mission 
        document providing the vision and the roadmap for the faster adoption of 
        electric vehicles and their manufacturing in the country. As part of the NEMMP 
        2020, Department of Heavy Industry formulated a Scheme viz. Faster</p>

        • Expansion of Kochi Metro Rail: the KMRL is operating MRTS in Kochi from Aluva 
        to Thykudam as on March 2020. The work on the stretch from Thykudam to Petta is 
        under construction and further extension up to Tripunithara is also under 
        execution stage. The line from JLN Stadium to Kakkanad is under planning stage. 
        K-Rail is also planning to have SilverLine Ernakulam Station at Kakkanad. This 
        will have positive impact on the ridership of SilverLine due to addressing of 
        first and last mile connectivity issues. The extension of line from Aluva to 
        Kochi Airport and Angamali is also under planning stage (DPR stage).

    <p class="style6">
        • Kochi Water Metro Project: the project is under execution stage and will be 
        implemented in two phases. Phase I with 7 routes and phase II with 9 routes 
        connecting various islands in Kochi Region. The total length will be 76 Km and 
        the line from Fort Kochi-Thevara-Vytilla-Kakkanad is expected to be operational 
        by 2021.</p>

    <p class="style7">
        The Cabinet Committee has also approved the construction of double line with 
        electrification between Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala and Kanniyakumari in Tamil 
        Nadu. The total length of the line will be 86.56 km while the estimated cost of 
        the Project will be Rs.1431.90 crore and completion cost of Rs.1552.94 crore 
        with 5% escalation per annum. 4.1.6.3 Impact of Transport Sector Projects and 
        Schemes on Silverline Impact of Road Projects on SilverLine The improvement 
        projects of NHs and SHs such as road widening and buindling of bypasses to NH 
        66, NH 766, SH 69, Kasaragod- Kanjagad Road etc., which are parallel to the 
        alignment of the SilverLine shall have a negative impact on the ridership of 
        SilverLine. This is mainly due to achieving higher journey speed and less 
        journey time by private modes as well as buses that reduces the travel time 
        savings. This in turn result in SILVERLINE (SEMI-HIGH SPEED RAIL) FROM 
        THIRUVANANTHAPURAM TO KASARAGOD DETAILED PROJECT REPORT (Version 2.1) Page | 
        4-150 negative shift due no change in cost savings. But, if the NHs and SHs are 
        made to toll roads, due to higher costs, it may lead to positive shift to 
        SilverLine. In case of other NHs and SHs such as NH – 544, 85, 744, 966, 183, 
        183 A &amp; 185 and SH perpendicular to SilverLine may act as feeder network. Any 
        improvements such as widening will improve the travel time of first mile and 
        last mile journey either by private vehicle or public transport. This may have a 
        positive impact on the ridership of the SilverLine with additional provisions of 
        inter-modal and interchange facilities with park and ride facilities. So 
        overall, the improvement to road project and the impact on the ridership 
        assessment may not be significant and if considered will have only positive 
        impact. Impact of Operations of Electric Vehicles India is embarking on the path 
        of adopting electric vehicles in the country with the target of all electric 
        vehicles fleet by 2030 as per the NITI Aayog. This seems quite ambitious 
        considering at present the electric vehicle fleet is less than one percent. A 
        review of global research and practices in electric mobility shows that electric 
        vehicles are very costly as compared to conventional vehicles while the 
        technology is also comparatively new to reach a significant level in the 
        vehicular fleet in any country. As stated earlier, FAME was introduced by the 
        Central Government and phase II focuses on deployment and operation of EV Buses 
        in Indian cities through private operators and STUs shall remain regulators. The 
        subsidy shall be disbursed based on per kilometer operational charges and only 
        when STUs have introduced Gross Cost, Net Cost or Hybrid operational models 
        involving private player for operations. In Kerala, the KSRTC invited tender for 
        selection of private operators for wet leasing and operation of buses. But, did 
        not materialize. At present the KSRTC is operating 8-9 buses on wet lease for 10 
        years duration. The 9- metre-long eBuzz K9 buses were manufactured by Olectra 
        Greentech in a tie-up with BYD. The wet lease bid was won by the Mumbai-based 
        Maha Voyage LLP with a quote of ₹ 43.20 per km (lowest). As per cost analysis of 
        KSRTC, it is anticipated to get a net balance of ₹6,500 per bus daily after 
        electricity cost and wet lease amount. The trial/pilot was done on route from 
        Nilakal (a place near sabarimala 20Km away and hilly terrain) to Sabarimala 
        during the previous Sabarimala season. Based on the data from transport 
        department, on an average, the BEVs operated 360 km daily on the Nilackal-Pampa 
        corridor. From the services, the KSRTC got a profit of ₹57 a km, including the 
        electricity cost, out of the fare collection of ₹110 a km. Only 0.8 unit of 
        electricity is needed for the BEV to run a kilometer. Compared to the 
        operational cost of ₹31 a km for HSD-powered buses, the BEVs operational cost is 
        ₹6. All these factors worked on trial basis but daily operations with large 
        fleet and charging infrastructure is yet to be assessed to know the actual 
        benefits. As per UITP, the acceptance of electric and hybrid buses is slow in 
        India, mainly due to cost factor. The average cost of hybrid or electric buses 
        is 3-4 times higher than diesel</p>

        <strong><em>Issues and challenges in Road Transport Sector</em></strong></p>
    <p class="style9">
        As per the Department of Economics and Statistics, Kerala, “most of the roads in 
        the State do not have adequate width to address the existing level of traffic, 
        only one fourth of the roads have either two lanes or four lane capacity while 
        most of the other roads have single lane or intermediate lane capacity. In the 
        case of National Highways also, only about 12 per cent of the roads have four 
        lane capacities while the remaining roads have only two lanes or intermediate 
        lane capacity. Bulk of the inter-city and interstate traffic is carried out by 
        the National and State Highways which constitutes only 8 per cent of the total 
        network. Considering the demand supply gap, there is a huge need for up 
        gradation of existing road network. The existing road network has to undergo a 
        qualitative improvement with the aim to reduce traffic congestion and delay, 
        easy access to destinations and reduction in accident risks. Most of the PWD 
        roads have to undergo massive upgradation with widening duly incorporating road 
        safety features”.</p>
    <p class="style10">
        <strong><em>Post Flood Scenario in Kerala:</em></strong></p>
    <p class="style10">
        As per the Kerala State Planning Board, “About 2004 km of State Highways and 
        13,246 km of MDR across 14 districts have suffered varying degree of damages 
        during the recent floods. The NH wing has estimated damage of about 580 km of 
        NHs. The post flood impact analysis indicates heavy damages due to land 
        slide/slips in the roads in four hill Districts of Idukki, Wayanad, 
        Pathanamthitta and Palakkad, whereas roads in the seven Districts of Alappuzha, 
        Thrissur, Ernakulam, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Kollam and Kottayam have sustained 
        flash floods, erosion, water stagnation and other flood induced damages. The 
        roads in Thiruvananthapuram, Kasaragod and Kannur Districts have also sustained 
        minimal damage. 1,090 km of State Highways and 6,527 km of MDRs have sustained 
        light damages and would largely require pavement rehabilitation through 
        patching, shoulder repairs and limited debris clearance. 734 km of State 
        Highways and 6,463 km of MDRs have sustained medium to heavy pavement damages 
        and would require re-laying of surfacing and limited repair of drainage, cross 
        drainage and protection works. 179 km of SH and 256 km of MDR have been fully 
        damaged and would require full pavement reconstruction, significant 
        repair/reconstruction of drainage, cross drainage and slope protection works and 
        limited road raising and new cross drainage works. The overall cumulative 
        damages for State Highways and MDR are estimated to be ₹7,647 crore and for NHs 
        an additional need of ₹911 crore has been assessed.
    </p>
    <p class="style10">
        The StateGovernment has started providing immediate short-term repair of 
        pavements and cross drainage structure, clearance of debris and temporary 
        protection works to restore the access and keep the roads traffic worthy. The 
        rehabilitation of the lightly damaged roads is largely through measures like 
        pothole patching, to keep the roads traffic worthy. 7,197 km of roads (734 km of 
        State Highways and 6,463 km of MDR) are severely damaged but are recoverable. 36 
        major and 178 minor bridges, 362 culverts, 43 km length of retaining wall and 
        169 km of roads side drainage works are severely damaged. Reconstruction of 
        bridges/culverts needs to be assigned priority followed by adequate hill slope 
        protection and flood protection works”.</p>

        <strong><em>Road Accidents </em></strong>
    </p>
    <p class="style10">
        Road accidents in the State are among the Nation’s highest. Kerala stands third 
        in terms of road accidents. Even though several initiatives have been taken by 
        the Police to enforce road discipline and enforcement of rules by Motor Vehicles 
        Department, road accidents are increasing. The bigger States like Uttar Pradesh, 
        Gujarat and Rajasthan report far less number of accidents compared to Kerala. 
        Rapid motorization in the number of vehicles registered in the State, has 
        created an intense pressure on the road infrastructure. In addition, the 
        increased number of accidents in the State is also a growing concern. Most of 
        the accidents are attributable to the fault of drivers as per records available 
        with traffic police. However, deficiencies in road design also affect motor 
        vehicles, a fact generally overlooked as bad road conditions. Road safety 
        training for various categories of road users, rectification in road design, 
        deficiencies in inclusion of road safety aspects in the planning and operation 
        stages of road construction are the primary facts to be taken up for reducing 
        accidents. The trend of road accidents in Kerala since 2001 is shown in Figure 
        4-18 . District wise road accident details for year 2018(1st January to 31st 
        December) is presented</p>

        <strong><em>DATABASE DEVELOPMENT</em></strong></p>
    <p class="style12">
        The aim of this report is to understand characteristics of existing 
        transportation systems by conducting traffic surveys in the project corridor. 
        The estimation of candidate traffic and patronage forecast requires well-defined 
        traffic database containing relevant information concerning traffic flow 
        characteristics. The broad methodology followed for the traffic surveys and 
        analysis is presented in Figure 4-11. Candidate traffic for rail and car are 
        also estimated in this report. Secondary data required for estimation of 
        candidate traffic from bus is being collected from major bus depots and private 
        bus operators. Reconnaissance survey done along the project corridor helped in 
        understanding general characteristics of the traffic along the corridor. It 
        helped in identifying survey locations, and provided valuable insight during 
        analysis. Secondary data such as railway reserved passenger data, bus trips, 
        toll traffic, fuel sales, railway goods traffic etc were collected . Primary 
        traffic surveys are conducted at pre-planned locations to identify existing 
        demand on transportation systems and characteristics of existing traffic. Data 
        collected from primary and secondary sources are analysed in detail and used as 
        the input for assessment of candidate traffic and SilverLine patronage forecast.</p>
    <p class="style13">
        <strong><em>Railway Reserved Passenger Data</em></strong></p>
    <p class="style13">
        Railway passenger data were collected through Railways Datawarehouse, Centre for 
        Railway Information Systems (CRIS) Reports. The data collected were compiled to 
        identify candidate traffic from railways. Only trains crossing at least 3 
        SilverLine station were considered. Passenger traffic corresponding to only one 
        direction has been compiled and demand in opposite direction is considered same. 
        Also only AC, Sleeper and Chair Car passengers were considered as potential 
        users. The passenger traffic data corresponds to the year 2018 (1st January to 
        31st December 2018). Origin and Destination (OD) matrix were formulated based on 
        data collected. Origin and destination of trips were classified as Internal or 
        External based on their location. Locations within Kerala were termed internal 
        and locations outside Kerala are termed External. Both Internal to Internal and 
        Internal to External traffic are included in candidate traffic. External to

    <p class="style15">
        The Origin – Destination (OD) survey was conducted to understand the existing 
        travel pattern on the project corridor and MC Road. OD survey of the passengers 
        was conducted at 9 locations along the project corridor. The study area has been 
        divided into 197 Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZ), based on which the analysis had 
        been carried out. OD Survey for both Passenger and Goods vehicles are conducted 
        simultaneously with traffic counts on a week day for 24 hours. During this 
        survey Trip Details viz. Origin and Destination, Trip length, Travel Cost, 
        Travel Time, Occupancy, Purpose, Willingness to Shift to SilverLine, Extra Fare 
        Willing to Pay for SilverLine etc are collected from passengers. In case of OD 
        survey for Goods vehicles the drivers are asked about their Trip Details 
        including Origin and Destination, Trip length, Commodity being carried, Tonnage, 
        Transportation cost, Willingness to use Roll-On- Roll-Off (RORO) services on 
        proposed SilverLine etc. These data is useful in determining travel 
        pattern/characteristics and willingness to shift to SilverLine of passenger and 
        goods vehicles.</p>

        <strong><em>Stated Preference/ Willingness To Pay (WTP) Survey</em></strong></p>
    <p class="style16">
        Onboard Willingness to Pay survey were carried out on Buses &amp; Trains that ply on 
        the identified study corridor and at Airports. This survey was conducted to 
        understand the user perception, Travel Characteristics and Willingness to Shift 
        to SilverLine System. Using the questionnaires, the user was enquired regarding 
        their socio-economic characteristics and travel pattern. Designed as a Stated 
        Preference Survey, WTP would help in assessing the user’s willingness to shift 
        to SilverLine with several important factors such as Cost, Time and Frequency, 
        that may affect the decision to choose the mode of transport for commuting. The 
        response of the same is being used for evaluating the shift to SilverLine from 
        other competing modes. The trains and buses that ply on the study corridor were 
        identified for the purpose and surveyed. Each Scenario in the questionnaire 
        refers to a set or combination of Travel Cost, Time and Frequency for both 
        SilverLine and the present mode, for a trip length of 200 km (based on 
        approximate distance between Thiruvananthapuram &amp; Ernakulam and Ernakulam &amp; 
        Kozhikode). Each of the six scenarios consists of variations in Travel Time, 
        Travel Cost and Frequency of SilverLine Service.</p>

        <strong><em>ESTIMATION OF POTENTIAL TRIPS</em></strong></p>
    <p class="style20">
        Potential trips are the most probable passengers who are potential to use 
        SilverLine. This section describes estimation of potential trips from Train, 
        Car/ Taxi, bus and potential airport trips. In case of train only AC Class, 
        Sleeper and Chair Car passengers are considered as potential users. In case of 
        car/ taxi and bus passengers, the trips are filtered from total traffic based on 
        trip length. Details and criteria of potential trips estimation is given in 
        subsequent sections. The potential trips from airport is estimated based on the 
        terminal OD survey conducted at each of the airport and based on the trip 
        lengths and main mode of travel from and to airports.</p>
    <p class="style21">
        <strong><em>Potential Trips - Buses</em></strong></p>
    <p class="style21">
        Data collected from OD survey at 9 locations is combined avoiding duplication of 
        data. Combined data is used to form an OD matrix of different type of buses, 
        such as for private AC bus, KSRTC AC and non-AC buses etc. To avoid vehicles 
        which might have travelled transverse to project corridor, a buffer zone of 15 
        km radial distance from SilverLine alignment was considered. In order to arrive 
        at the target group of Car/Taxi users, trips with trip length less than 50 km 
        are discarded, if both origin and destination are within buffer zone. Similarly 
        trips with trip length less than 75 km and 100 km are discarded if either origin 
        or destination is outside buffer zone and if both origin and destination is 
        outside buffer zone respectively. Candidate traffic from buses for the year 2019 
        are provided in the table below:-</p>

        <strong><em>STATED PREFERENCE/ WILLINGNESS TO PAY (WTP) SURVEY </em></strong></p>
    <p class="style21">
        Stated Preference survey was conducted at Airports, major bus terminals, 
        on-board buses and major trains and different class of trains along the proposed 
        SilverLine corridor. The regional bus, train AC, train Non AC and AC bus users 
        were interviewed to appreciate the personal characteristics, travel details, 
        willingness to pay and shift to SilverLine and opinion on preference on 6 
        hypothetical transport scenarios. The data was used for development of modal 
        equations for determining likely shift to SilverLine. A total of 1000 responses 
        were collected from different users along the proposed SilverLine corridor. 
        Willingness to Pay survey was carried to understand the user perception, travel 
        characteristics and willingness to shift to SilverLine System. Each Scenario in 
        the questionnaire refers to a set or combination of Travel Cost, Time and 
        Frequency for both SilverLine and the present mode, for an average trip length 
        of 200 km</p>
    <p class="style16">
        <asp:Image ID="Image20" runat="server" 
            ImageUrl="~/assets/img/dprfinal report/Untitled-19.jpg" />
    </p>
    <p class="style16">
        A general trend observed from the data collected by M/s P.K Engineers is that as 
        fare increases willingness to shift to SilverLine decreases and people will 
        prefer present mode. People travelling by Flight and AC class are showing more 
        willingness to shift to SilverLine across all scenarios. Also at same fare, as 
        frequency decreases people are showing less willingness to shift to SilverLine.</p>
    <p class="style16">
        As per the preliminary analysis, the results are not logical. For example, the 
        willingness to shift to SilverLine from Sleeper Class Train is about 95% at a 
        fare of Rs 500 (almost 3 times the current fare of Sleeper Class) and frequency 
        of 30 min. There is a similar trend of respondents showing higher willingness to 
        shift to SilverLine for other Scenarios, which seems not logical. So, samples 
        were selected for further analysis based on logical assumptions, such as:</p>
    <p class="style16">
        1) Daily travel commuters with monthly income less than INR 20,000/- and INR 
        10,000/- and Stated to shift for daily commute were removed. </p>
    <p class="style16">
        2) The commuters who Stated that at higher fares, willing to shift and at lower 
        fares, not willing to shift were removed. This is because of lack of 
        understating of the scenarios by the commuters. </p>
    <p class="style16">
        3) The origin and destination of the commuters which are falling majorly outside 
        the PIA and still Stated to shift were also removed from analysis. </p>
    <p class="style16">
        Based on the above assumptions, out of 1100 samples collected from various 
        modes, only 380 samples were shortlisted for further analysis. 4.10.1 Mode Shift 
        Analysis Stated Preference surveys were conducted to determine willingness to 
        pay, potential mode shift and value of time of various users of SilverLine 
        system. A well-structured format was made describing multiple scenarios to the 
        users under varying parameter ranges. Mode wise binary logit models which give 
        the probability of shifting from existing alternatives to SilverLine were 
        developed using the preferences indicated by the respondents. </p>
    <p class="style16">
        These models are of the following form. The purpose of Mode Shift analysis is to 
        determine the probability of shift to SilverLine from various modes.</p>
    <p class="style16">
        &nbsp;e^(Gx) P = …………. </p>
    <p class="style16">
        Where P = probability of shift,</p>
    <p class="style16">
        &nbsp;Gx = generalised cost (1+ e^(Gx)) Gx = Constant + α STT+ β STC+ γ SWT + λ 
        STR Where,</p>
    <p class="style16">
        &nbsp;STT = Savings in Travel Time (Including Access &amp; Dispersal Time)</p>
    <p class="style16">
        &nbsp;STC = Savings in Travel cost (including access &amp; egress cost) </p>
    <p class="style16">
        SWT = Savings in Waiting time </p>
    <p class="style16">
        STR = Savings in number of transfer in the journey </p>
    <p class="style16">
        α β γ λ = Parameters to be estimated using SP data and Constant = constant that 
        explains the unobserved effects T</p>
    <p class="style16">
        he generalised cost of different modes like Car, Bus and Train are estimated 
        based on the travel cost, travel time of the trips and wait time. The wait time 
        was assumed based on the frequency for all modes. The parameters of the mode 
        wise logit models were calibrated by employing maximum likelihood method of 
        estimation. The results of calibration for different modes w.r.t SilverLine are 
        provided in the table below. The signs of all the parameters are found to be 
        logical. All the variables that entered the model are found to be statistically 
        significant. </p>
    <p class="style22">
        <strong><em>ESTIMATED GROWTH RATES </em></strong></p>
    <p class="style16">
        For an efficient proposal, existing and proposed facilities are analysed for 
        future. This covers existing, additional and forecasted commuters for proposed 
        SilverLine, existing and future demand on allied infrastructure such as 
        stations, parking etc., due to proposed facilities. The expected traffic growth 
        due to a transport infrastructure plays a crucial role in operation planning, 
        station design, commuter facilities based on commuter footfall in that region. 
        Since, there are various independent variables affecting the dependent 
        variables. It becomes a challenge to accurately predict/estimate these growth 
        rates. Many uncertainties are associated with the independent variables which go 
        into the procedure of estimating the growth rates. The uncertainties are in the 
        form of changes in National economy, Government policy, socio-economic 
        conditions of the people, changes in land uses and development of another 
        transportation infrastructures. Planning of SilverLine and its viability is 
        dependent on the projected traffic. In practice, future traffic growth rate is 
        influenced by numerous parameters. Therefore, while carrying out the traffic 
        forecast, it should be kept in mind that all the parameters are assessed at the 
        macro level of the country’s economy. Economic indicators like Per capita Income 
        (PCI), Net State Domestic Product (NSDP), Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) 
        and District Domestic Product (DDP), population and vehicle registration data 
        are associated with the traffic growth in an Economic Model. Recognizing this, 
        efforts are made to carefully assess all the parameters that help in predicting 
        the traffic demand in future which necessitates realistic estimation of traffic 
        growth rates. For this project traffic growth rates are estimated using 
        Elasticity method.</p>
    <p class="style22">
        <strong><em>Approach </em></strong></p>
    <p class="style16">
        Future prospects of project influence area are analysed, while past trend in 
        growth is also considered during forecasting traffic for the hub. For long term 
        forecasting elasticity approach of growth rate estimation is used. The approach 
        included following steps:- 1. Potential of Growth of various vehicle categories 
        (car), passengers (in case of rail passengers), and earnings (in case of bus) 
        are separately assessed based on its probable market share in expected 
        multi-modal travel characteristics. 2. Per Capita Income (PCI) of Kerala is 
        considered for determining growth rate of private vehicles like cars and other 
        public transport modes such as bus and rail passengers etc. 3. Regional Economic 
        factors such as Growth in Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) and Net State 
        Domestic Product (NSDP) is also studied and checked for determining growth rate 
        of different types of rail and bus passengers and also goods traffic</p>
    <p class="style16">
        To improve the ridership during the operational years, following planning and 
        policy interventions are recommended:</p>
    <p class="style16">
        &nbsp;- a) Multi-modal integration: All SilverLine stations are recommended to 
        be developed on multi-modal integration concept, in which users from 
        silver-line, road, water, rail and other modes can interchange modes with ease, 
        conflict free and faster transfer. </p>
    <p class="style16">
        b) SilverLine to be part of mobility network: SilverLine is not to be treated as 
        an independent transport system and should be integrated and shall form part of 
        larger mobility network in Kerala involving, rail line, air, road, water and NMT 
        networks.</p>
    <p class="style16">
        Within the network, SilverLine to be of highest hierarchy. Comprehensive 
        mobility plans/regional mobility plans to be prepared in all districts in line 
        with SilverLine. KMTA is formed for Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode 
        and this shall be the responsibility of the KMTA. The GoK is also taking 
        SILVERLINE (SEMI-HIGH SPEED RAIL) FROM THIRUVANANTHAPURAM TO KASARAGOD DETAILED 
        PROJECT REPORT (Version 2.1) Page | 4-266 initiative to constitute a directorate 
        for mobility. In case the directorate is formed, all the transport planning 
        related activities shall be the responsibility of the directorate. c) Provision 
        of park and ride facilities at SilverLine stations. All stations shall be 
        provided with ample parking facility and also with electric charging points. 
        Discounts for park and ride shall be considered during the execution stage. </p>
    <p class="style16">
        d) Provision of city feeders to provide accessibility from SilverLine stations 
        to nearby city centres – Central Business Districts (CBD) and other catchments. 
        The city feeder can be operated by the SPV or by STU (KSRTC) or by the private 
        players. The only requirement is to have integrate timetable and ticketing for 
        feeder and SilverLine. e) Conducting periodic traffic surveys: traffic surveys 
        including opinion surveys are to be conducted just before commissioning to 
        re-establish the ridership estimates, fares and also every 3 years (minimum) 
        during operational years. A detailed transport model can be prepared during the 
        next stage and update it frequently based on any changes in the mobility 
        pattern. f) Provision of Travel discounts: group discounts, monthly pass, 
        discount on return tickets etc., may also be considered for attracting more 
        users. The discounts provided may be compensated by considering revenue from 
        other non-fare revenue sources such as:- </p>
    <p class="style16">
        1) Property development </p>
    <p class="style16">
        2) TOD </p>
    <p class="style16">
        3) Revenue from lease of infrastructure – telecom towers (intelligent street 
        poles), lease of Optical fibre, lease of utility duct for transporting oil, gas 
        etc. </p>
    <p class="style16">
        4) Other commercial development.</p>
